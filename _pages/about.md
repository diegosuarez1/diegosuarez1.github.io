My name is Diego Acosta Suarez, I am studying Computer Engineering at Virginia Tech. My hobbies are boxing, going to the gym, crypto,
and football. I currently am working on(still in production phase) a website for my own constructed AI LLM Gateway service called [CitadexAI](https://citadexai.com). I am seeking to grow my knowledge in coding and create tools to help the world someday. Outside of spare time building my site, I like to go to the gym, War memorial is my favorite spot. Having to juggle classes, side projects, extracurriculars, and gym has allowed me to get deep understanding into the importance of time management. which is crucial for success in any topic or specialty. My name is Diego and welcome to my site, I hope you enjoy!
